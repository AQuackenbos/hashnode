I never know what to write for a first blog post. I always feel as if it should be introductory somehow, even if there's an entire profile section nearby if anyone really wanted to go find out more.

Software is going to be far from the only thing I talk about here. Hell, it may not even be the primary thing. Frankly, I have a hard time starting to talk about something, but once I start, you can't shut me up. My stream of consciousness simply takes the wheel, and only pauses for the occasional fact-check.  
  
Of course, I have ADHD so that act of fact-checking sometimes leads to an entirely different adventure. But that's life; we don't always get to choose what sparks us, but we can choose whether or not to feed the fire.
