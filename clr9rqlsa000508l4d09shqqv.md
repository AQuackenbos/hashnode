This is my fourth attempt at starting this particular blog. Or at least, one within this iteration chain. I've attempted to start countless blogs before. Or blog-like areas. Personal public diaries. An odd concept, really. I'll warn you now that once I begin writing, I keep going for far too long. I don't expect all of this text to mean anything deep to anyone besides myself, but if you find any peace in it, I'm touched that I could help you locate it.

I think it'll stick this time though. At least for a bit. I worry a bit of course, that it's just that new year attitude - "new year, new attempt at change". But I have my reasons for believing in it this time, more than others. I'm also becoming highly aware of how infrequently I place a comma in my written sentences when I'm typing from my stream of consciousness. The biggest reason is simple though: I finally know what the blog will be about.

I kept trying to make this blog about something. I gave it a name - "Software and Sorcery". A catchy little alliterative play on Dungeons and Dragons, and I do like the name. I figured that would cover my bases, and allow me to talk about my interests in a wide variety of areas; I'm a software engineer, who also enjoys role playing games, and a big list of random interests that could be a week old or span my entire life. I assumed the blog would be about that, when I felt like I wanted to write something.

My problem is multi-faceted however;

* I *often* want to write things, but most often, when I'm completely occupied.
    
* I have a particular love for the [sidenote](https://gwern.net/sidenote) and keep telling myself to implement something like it before even beginning.
    
* My mood changes a lot, so if I don't finish a piece of writing, I may never return to it: the mood might never be *quite* like that again.
    
* Publishing my writing feels egocentric and self-important, neither of which I particularly relish.
    

Yet, you're reading this. At least I hope you are. I'm telling myself as I type this that the publish button will be pressed when I stop typing, regardless of what is here. My hangups about sharing my thoughts in general share a common thread, which is that they are self-driven: no one is stopping me but myself. As such, I simply need to get out of the way and let myself write; right? Simple.

### Self?

Simple. It's a word with a lot of weight. It implies triviality to the task at hand. It washes away the idea of complexity being a factor, and states the problem as if it were a direct and solvable matter. I like simple things. Simple tends to work well, and work efficiently. Elegance is often simply the combination of combining simple things without them interfering with each other. I think many people desire their lives to be simple. A simple life, surely, must have less trouble than a confusing or complex one.

Simple is a matter of perspective, though.

<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong><em>Aside.</em></strong> So one of my hundreds of self-inflicted "reasons" to avoid writing like this is that I can rarely stick to one topic. I ramble and I wander and I lose track of what I was doing. I have ADHD and very likely Autism - this post isn't about diagnosis meaning or neurodivergence or anything down that path, but there'll be one eventually no doubt. It also means my emotions and moods sway rapidly. It means reading shitty news about someone half a world away can ruin my day right here. It's a persistent and ever-present part of my life, and while there are aspects I love about myself that can probably be credited to it, there are also aspects I despise and would change in the blink of an eye if I could. Being randomly overwhelmed by emotions is one of them.</div>
</div>

Simple is rarely a definition once you leave the world of physics and machines. Simple becomes a nebulous concept of *this is supposed to be easy, so why isn't it*. Simple is a word used to manipulate others - it's simple, *just do it*. Like many words, it holds power beyond its dictionary entry, amplified by a society structured on reading between the lines to succeed. It can be wielded to create shame in others. It can quietly create shame in yourself without even trying.

### self.

The concept of self is perhaps the core shared human experience; well, not the concept itself, exactly, but rather: the struggle to define it. I've yet to meet anyone who at no point in their life asked the question, "who am I". But the search for one's self-definition is societally frowned upon, unless that self fits within a very tight mold.

We are told to find it, yet never wander too far from our responsibilities while doing so. We are encouraged to explore it, while under the constant threat of a world that rewards consistency above all else. Experimentation advertises itself to us constantly, with the quiet yet open acknowledgement that choosing to experiment will cost something great; whether it's money, or time, or friends, or family, or more - the world makes one thing clear, which is that experimenting is costly. Change is inconsistency, and inconsistency is inefficient. Our strongly-typed society has little room for inefficiencies now.

### `self`.

Programming has always been the most consistent part of my life. No matter how my moods swing or my tendencies change, I keep coding. Part of that, of course, is because it has become a very convenient career for me. Perhaps the biggest stroke of luck in my entire life is that my penultimate (I doubt this post will get to the *ultimate*) fixation happened to be on something deemed "useful" by capitalism. Many people I know are not able to transform their passion into <s>survival</s> money so easily; I hope they can one day.

It has also given me a bit of perspective at times, when considering what the self is. See, at the core of it, "we" (the generations of brilliant engineers ranging in era from Ada Lovelace to modern day geniuses) mostly designed computers and their systems to operate similarly to our understanding of the human body. There's likely some evidence this was intentional, but I can't be asked to look it up right now. When I write about things where facts are critical, sources are cited; when I'm concerned with the larger emotions and narrative, apply as much salt as required.

I've found surprising depth in the similarities though. I'm far from the first autistic person to say they think like a computer (and not all do, it's a wide range of entirely valid experiences). Contextualizing my brain in the terms we apply to logical machines has unlocked great utility though. I had an unexpected - and to be honest, mildly alarming - breakthrough when I first learned what context to supply and how to re-structure questions for an LLM to produce good results, only to find that the same tactics worked on my own thought process. I'll leave the conspiracy-fueled depths of that anecdote to someone more willing to explore them.

One little practice I've always found comforting (in its own way) is how we must keep manual references for programs, at times. We store references to a version of themselves, to remind them where to find it after executing something else. It's the kind of reference I wish I could tell my own ADHD brain to keep, and point back to at the end of a tangent. In many languages, the "common practice" is to even call this reference `self`, assuming the language hasn't gone ahead and done it for you.

```javascript
function experiment() {
  const self = this
  function contrivedExample() {
    // The irony of this being poor practice
    self.change = // ...
  }
}
```

Poor programming examples aside, the defined nature of such a practice is quite interesting: we want the mechanisms to change ourselves, without forgetting what we brought with us already. I will not be commenting (today) on whether or not I believe we live in a simulation, a parallel universe, or a particularly in-depth arthouse film.

### ***Self.***

I keep circling the topic. This is normal for me. My brain *thinks* in circles. This can be useful; the rounding curves often give me angles on problems that those walking in straight lines would miss. But it also means that the path from a question to an answer is circuitous, vague, and gives little indication of whether it's going anywhere or not. After all, the defining aspect of a circle, from the view of someone along its path, is that it is all the same; each degree the same as the one before it, each curve the same gentle angle, each length joining in perfect symmetry. Perhaps thinking this way is peaceful, while living in a world where each piece is an entirely different beast to navigate.

This blog is going to be my own self-centered, self-important thoughts on whatever topic strikes me to ramble about. I suppose that sentence should have appeared about... 10 paragraphs ago, but life comes at you fast. I am accepting my own concerns about its self-righteousness, true relevance, or even meaning, and simply (heh) ignoring them. I can no longer afford not to. The next section is going to be personal and whiny, and you have now been warned ahead of time. Actually, being whiny is most of what this blog is *actually* about, so, take that as you will.

### $‚ç∑‚é£‚Ñâ

My "self" has diminished greatly as of late. I want to say it started to dissipate about 6 months ago, but then I reconsider and say a year ago, and then I reconsider and say three years, and then I reconsider and say seven. The closest thing to the objective truth I can give is that it began roughly 7 years ago, when the sudden loss of a close friend forced a re-evaluation of many things I had simply taken for granted. Like many people in their 20s (as I was then), I had not been challenged by harsh loss yet - I know many also *are* forced to face it even younger, and to you, I simply say "sorry" in a tone that now better understands what a challenge that represents. To say I understand would be insulting.

Since then, pieces of my identity have begun to crack and chip away. I won't go into every example (today), but aspects that I once thought were foundational have fallen away entirely at this point. I didn't even realize the journey I had started until several years in. I still feel unsure whether I've defined the entire scope of it. In Dungeons and Dragons, "Reincarnation" brings you back, but not always in the same form you were; this concept has always held some allure for me.

<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong><em>Aside.</em></strong> When I say Dungeons and Dragons, or D&amp;D, I am <em>almost</em> always actually referring to the larger collective of pen and paper games meant to allow one to express their imaginative desires within a set of constraints and rules that create meaning, and <em>generally</em> am probably actually referring to Pathfinder. The trick is that saying D&amp;D will connect with more people, by giving them an immediate mental image and context for the same type of scenario, regardless of which products or editions they choose to enjoy. Not everything is meant to be taken literally, my problem is generally just not labeling which are which.</div>

### ‚êÖ‚êï‚êñ‚êõ;

I feel as though I have died. Many times, really. There have been times where I died because I wanted to, and times I have wanted to die but did not. There are deaths caused by myself, and deaths caused by others. I often hear people discuss this sort of self-rebirth with a triumphant essence to it: the image of a phoenix rising from the ashes, of a hero standing one more time against the darkness. But I think we die more often than we realize.

Death is something I have... considerable thoughts on. That will be its own post at some point. But I suppose for a long time, I considered each death to simply be a temporary hurdle; I was resurrected, brought back for another round, now with the lessons of my last life attached. It was a continuation of the same dream along the same path, perhaps with a few extra bruises, but ultimately not much different. Death was a means to close one chapter and open another.

For many deaths, I did not even realize they had happened until well past the point of rebirth. Each death did have a cost though; like experimentation, the world does not let you die without losing something. This was generally how I marked them, by what I left behind. "In a different life" would start many sentences about hobbies or games or people I no longer connected to in the same way as I did before I died again. That is how they feel, in all truth; there are pieces of me that I know I once had, but can never return to. What signifies that permanent change more than death itself?

### SELF.

I had a problem though. Death started becoming more costly. I was no longer the initiator of most of them. They came more rapidly, and with little pretense. It was only my latest death that caused me to pause and reflect on this. A layoff at an inopportune time, creating a collapse of high-pressure scenarios around me as I laid in the dirt, working to dig myself out yet again. It was only as I thrashed at the dirt with more and more frenzy that it dawned on me how much longer this was taking than other deaths. It was only then that I noticed I was no longer pushing dirt out of the way with hands, but instead raking it with claws. The dirt didn't even move past me; it simply slid off my torso and held down my wings.

I was not escaping the loss and the pain. I was just weighing down a different part of me with it instead. A part of me that I hadn't even realized existed. I was not being resurrected with each death; I was being reincarnated, but avoiding the mirrors that may have stopped me from stubbornly getting back on the same circular path I thought I was still walking.

The circle had gone from a consistent and secure path to being a prison instead. My feet no longer fit into the ridges of the footprints from the last time I walked this direction. As dozens of different footprints smashed on top of each other, the safe path had become nothing more than a directionless trail of mud, each step feeling more stuck than the last.

I no longer knew what my "self" was.

### .fles

If you were thinking that this will end with me discovering my true self, well. First of all, you're a lot more invested in this ridiculously long ramble than I would have guessed. But it doesn't end that way. Or at all, really.

Seven years was perhaps a conservative estimate for when I really began dying more. It took a lot of reincarnation to realize that. One's "original form", if such a thing exists, is almost always lost during childhood; even well-intentioned parents kill dozens of half-formed little selves before they have the chance to grow. We are all cursed by the truest shared experience of humanity: imperfection. The critical and absolute inability to act with 100% understanding and capacity in every situation guarantees that we will pass along some amount of our trauma to others; this also guarantees that humanity will persist.

### me.

I never got to meet her. Not really. The first me. She died at some point a very long time ago; whether it was when she was told not to paint her nails, or when she was told her voice was too high, it's hard to be sure. Perhaps she died when she asked for dolls and was given a baseball glove, or when she was signed up for soccer instead of ballet. Or maybe, just maybe, she was already smart enough to know that you don't come back in the same form after you die, and that she didn't seem to be fitting in very well in her current form. Maybe I'm just lucky she wasn't old enough or scared enough to make it permanent. Not everyone lives long enough to die as many times as they need to.

Every time I've ever had my players roll on the Reincarnation table, there's a mix of glee and fear in their eyes. Their allies are nervous that they'll become something monstrous, hard to handle, or too foreign to understand. But more than anything else, they're happy; happy to bring their friend back. Happy to keep inviting them on journeys.

The player themself is the most important face to watch though. More often than not, they enjoyed the form they were in: fantasy lets us shape characters the way we wish we could in life, so it makes sense that they fear the loss of their chosen form. Their eyes betray that deep fear of loss inside us, that doesn't know *what* we'll lose, but only that we *will* lose something. But they fear death more than they fear becoming a centaur, so they roll on the table.

Sometimes though, they're excited. Maybe they've realized that their ideal character is something a bit different, and this could be a step towards getting there. They may just want something new as well - this is fantasy, and a game, after all; not every moment and decision needs to be wrapped in allegory and echo some real-world pain the player is going through. If you look long enough, and deep enough, though, it usually does.

But there's one group of players who is always excited. It's those who have already died. It's the people who have been pressed past their limits before, broken and destroyed, and already seen their bodies reshaped. Some of them are in the same form they started in, though not all. Many of them have grievous wounds, permanent injuries, and more than a little psychological angst.

These players know what rolling on the reincarnation table means. Another chance. Another opportunity to be themselves. One more excursion back to the realm of the living, granted by their friends and allies - the most likely people to bring someone back from the dead - and fulfilled by continuing onwards, letting not even death stop their search for their true self.

Many of the ones reincarnated before stare at the table and study it first. They want to know what the odds are. They want to know their chances. We rarely get that privilege in the real world, at least before we see the view from halfway down; and at that point, knowing the odds doesn't matter much. Those players are the most fascinating. Every death teaches you something. Those lessons learned from each new death add up.

### Myself.

When I died before, each time, I brushed it off. I stood up and kept walking forward, insistent that I could not be kept down. Resolute and reinvigorated, I would shift and change to be what I needed to be to keep moving forward. Others praised me, congratulated me, and depending on the death itself, even lifted me up and called me strong. It felt right and was rewarded.

It was a mistake.

When we are pushed past that line, our bodies and our selves cry out, wishing we were stronger, and that we could just persevere. And often, in our reincarnation, we find that strength. We lick our wounds, stand back up, and like the invulnerable hero on their journey, steel ourselves for the press forward, and quite often, take that step.

But, the only thing I'm quite sure of at this point, is that we shouldn't. It's 2024. The world is effectively on fire. Our bastions of knowledge have turned into channels for mischief. We seem closer to peace then ever, as wars wage over shrinking resources we could have saved. There is no stalwart paladin, and there is no overwhelming dragon to face - at least not one that can be faced with blades and bows.

Pushing forward despite the odds means not evaluating those odds. It means not truly facing the forces that killed your last self to begin with. It means not stepping back and asking if the path you're on is still your path. If you are still the self that was meant to walk that path, or even if you were ever supposed to be on that path; blindly pushing onwards, admits that you are still blind.

Death of self is an opportunity for reincarnation. It is a chance to take stock of what the situation really is. Of what holds you down. Of what blade is in your back this time. It is a new chance to meet ourselves, in whatever form we take.

Those players who study the table aren't always looking for what new shape they'd enjoy the most. They've reincarnated before. They are no longer the self they once were, and they know that. They've seen themselves for what they are now, and they've learned more about who they are. They're looking for the odds of becoming their first self again. The chance to return to that form, with all the newly gained information they have. The miraculous opportunity to become who they once were, but empowered by a greater understanding of their own heart, and their own needs. A chance to be themselves, realized fully.

And sometimes, they get it. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
