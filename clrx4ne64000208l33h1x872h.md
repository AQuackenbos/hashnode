The awkward truth about my previous post is that it does not accurately self-describe, which is the actual structure of this blog. Each post reflects its meaning to my brain within the topic of the title. *However*, it does accurately match its thesis statement, which is to describe what the blog is.

Which would then mean: I am writing about myself, without knowing what I am.

I don't know if I set out to write those words, but they are the words that are written. And each action we take, meaningless as it is, has an impact. It decides which multi-versal thread we follow, since each action takes immeasurable minutia of energy to accomplish, each delta altering the ultimate state of the universe by a microfraction.

This makes it impossible to quantitate whether falling asleep 8 minutes earlier tonight, due to the energy expense of typing words into a laptop, might alter a decision or consequence I suffer a week from today; as such, we should pursue as many experiences as possible while they are available to us, because the future state of the universe is an incalculable riddle.

### Disidentifying.

I am at an awkward state of reality as I write this. I have, largely, disowned my former identity. However, embracing my new identity has been difficult at best. This is almost entirely self-driven, as is often the case. The first step in changing anything is accepting that it needs to be changed; there's no reason the case would be any different with gender.

I am no longer a cisgendered male. That much, I'm aware of. But the details beyond that get hazy very quickly. Gender fluid, gender queer, gender questioning - were a short stay, but ultimately felt too uncertain to fit my feelings about identity. As my therapist would share with you were she not bound by legal restrictions, I have an unhealthy obsession with labels, particularly when they come to my own. The irony is that when it comes to others putting labels on me, I generally accept them without question; perhaps that speaks to my propensity for bottoming.

If you didn't enjoy that bit of kinky humor, this may not be the blog for you.

Non-binary comes with its own degree of uncertainty, but what drew (hah) me towards it is the nature itself. It seems, in a generally-explainable way, *certain* of its uncertainty, perhaps because it has had time to fight for existence of its own within the spectrum of Publicly Acceptable Genders‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. However, even within that comfort - where I still sit, as of when I write this at least - there are so many unresolved questions. Some NB consider themselves trans, some don't - some also see it as a distinctly trans identity, which is a bit stronger. I *think* I consider myself trans, but I still struggle to use words like "trans" or "queer" to identify myself to others. They feel almost like badges of valor I have not "earned" in some form.

### Labels and targets.

This is, of course, a flawed concept. Identifying labels are not earned, though there is a philosophical argument about self-selection within the context of automated assignment; that is NOT to support an argument of purposeful neglect of one's self-selected identity once it is learned: or in less categorical speaking, misgendering is wrong, harmful, and an act of malice when done on purpose, but the degree of "assumability" on the part of the actor must be taken into account if there is not sufficient reason to believe it on-purpose. I think this is generally understood by the queer community, to be honest; it is, however, misrepresented by common media and sometimes even well-meaning allies, appearing as a hairpin trigger ready to give the queer person a "reason" to make an example of the theoretical heteronormative individual who could accidentally incite their "cancel culture". This representation is beyond inaccurate; it is an active harm to the queer community.

The misbelief that the majority of queer individuals are ready to incur some wrath on a non-queer person simply for a mistake or misunderstanding is perpetuated as a stereotype in media even today. The "aggressor" - the queer person in said media - is generally a feminine-presenting person, but with surface-level coding for a more "butch" or "alternative" variant. They most often direct some amount of unearned aggression on a side character in modern media; the protagonist experiencing it seems to occur more often in media that tend to "take aim" at the queer community, and do so with the hope of presenting them as an enemy of "normal" individuals. Those have thankfully gotten rare, outside of heavily right-wing funded indie media outlets; these studios tend to be run with the intent of producing at-loss rage bait in limited-run theaters. You cannot fail if you never intend to succeed: their box office abyss will not be discussed, and they are doomed to failure long before anything akin to a boycott is started. However, they will buy advertising space aimed at queer individuals to give the movie a larger presence in their space, and attempt to play off the community's frustration to make them appear hostile and intolerant. Even the occasional success of this tactic is enough to keep it worthwhile for them.

Making a community "appear hostile" is segregation 101. The only rule is that there *must* be a "them". There must be some intangible aspect about "them" that you don't understand - and a good reason not to find out. The lack of understanding is easily constructed within our heteronormative society: the idea that there are exactly 2 genders, and that they pair only with the opposite gender, is ingrained in children from nearly the moment they are born. Even queer parents struggle with the ways that heteronormative expectations and explanations are baked into society. I even have to catch my own speech, about to parrot some example or anecdote I was told 20 years ago, only to realize part way through that it is not an accurate reflection of how a human is - only how "normal" society would categorize it.

It's in the air itself, it feels like. The environment of a queer-run and queer-centered event is a surreal existence compared to day-to-day life. You don't realize the discomfort you're sitting in until you're not sitting in it anymore, for a brief moment. When its weight returns, it is the weight of the label "other" being put back around your neck. After a night out at a queer-run club, watching two women at the subway visibly dismiss a more intimate gesture that a straight couple might do without a second thought is a distilling re-entry to the "real world".

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üß†</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">And sure, they could have been like, tired or maybe had a rough morning and this had absolutely nothing to do with prejudice or gay panic, but I'm the brand of insane person who invents entire realities off of two second easily misunderstood events. And if you haven't realized that yet, please make sure your rose-tinted glasses are the right prescription.</div>
</div>

Regardless of the precise reality, the weight is present. The chance is present. The uncertainty. Uncertainty has defined my world lately; it may as well fit as my gender definition as well. My identity is certain of its reality now, however; it does not question whether it is real. It is real - it is simply uncertain.

### Self-selection.

The reality of queerness is much like the ADHD that afflicts me; a self-abrasive dichotomy. And no, the irony of presenting these as binary scenarios is not lost on me. But it is truly constant: for instance, feeling deeply comfortable in a skirt, yet terribly uncomfortable when perceived in one. Feeling disconnected from both common genders, yet connected to both in undeniable ways.

But easiest to misunderstand at first is the degree to which a queer identity is *both* chosen and unchosen. It took considerable time for me to understand the awkward intersection at which a queer identity sits. It is key that the two parts are separate: a queer person is both *who they say they are now* **and** *who they are when they were born*. That is to say: the form you see them in now is the form that they were born in; it is society that morphs them into what they once were. As such, we are all unknowingly tasked with identifying ourselves at some point; it is only those who feel the ache of discomfort from their assigned role who begin the investigation sooner. I believe there are many queer individuals living distinctly non-queer lives, only because the label society gave them was "close enough" to never pursue the accurate version. I want a world where self-discovery is so encouraged that this is normal.

<div data-node-type="callout-text">Is it not irony, that the vilified self-identification of a queer by conservatives is, in reality, simply the individualism they claim to support? The accurate labeling of oneself is truly an exercise in ceaseless self-investigation and optimization to both discover and and redirect the growth of one's own self from the predefined course society set it on, and onto the path best fit for one's own identity. It is the reality they claim to aspire for, while they fall short of the self-reflection any trans person had to undergo simply to confirm to <em>themselves</em> they they are trans. Without even comparing the empathy required for people so fiercely individual to form a thriving, supportive, and constantly-evolving community.</div>

### Disproving disapproval.

It is perhaps this where my question still hangs slightly. The specifics of an identity are, to a degree, "unimportant". For most relationships in my life, stating that I'm non-binary is sufficient. Well, you know, factoring out random potential bigotry or whatnot. And government recognition of the non-binary gender for legal purposes. The point is, a high-level label is fine in 90% of scenarios. The form doesn't need the breakdown of "non-binary transfeminine" or whatever I identify as this week.

That is, for the record, my identity this week. I'm not great at presenting data, I talk too much. Frankly, if there's ever a "get AI summary" button in your browser for these posts, just fucking use. It will figure it out better.

However, the question lies within the alternate case. The best proofs have both a Direct and Contraposition method. So far I have only the direct, though; the contraposition is much harder. To escape the mathematics into our domain-specific language, a contraposition of my feminine identity would posit:

* If *I were born and assigned masculine*, I would *discover a feminine identity*
    
* Therefore, if *I were born and assigned feminine*, I would *discover a male identity*
    

Which is essentially to ask: am I discovering that I am non-binary (proof posit), or am I simply on a stepping stone?

### Spectrums.

If you haven't guessed that I'm on the autism spectrum by now, congratulations, you're me for the first 35 years of my life. Also, this is definitely the blog for you.

There are days that I don't feel connected to my femininity. There are days I do. Which are dysphoria? Who's to say. Well, I mean, probably my therapist. That's not the point of typing this.

Is there a point? Perhaps that is the point. All of this minutia, this detail-driven self-analysis, the lack of self-belief; it all serves a purpose, but perhaps lacks a point. It is required, for me, and I think it should be embraced by anyone that wants to to do it - and I think most people ought want to do it - but I don't know if it will actually *yield* anything beyond what it already has, which is simply to acknowledge that I am uncomfortable within gender norms. They have become too itchy to sit within any longer.

They still cause strife in my day-to-day; for instance, what is "feminine"? What article of clothing, what amount of mascara, what color nails shift me from "male" to "female" in the eyes of another human? When I look at myself, I know how I perceive me. But when I feel the perception of others, doubt fills depending on what I wear. Feeling too revealing as a feminine person has a weight of shame that I never once experienced in a purely masculine identity; is it some kind of sign that I already have the embedded self-image shame that every woman I've ever talked to suffers from?

The masculine side is jut as confusing though. I've realized the severe discomfort I have within a "masculine space" - one devoid of female energy or acceptance. The obvious culprits are there - the locker room, the bachelor party, etc - but there are some I didn't realize for too long. The home repair is one. It is defaultly masculine of course - the stereotypical "traditional family structure" that we seem to base so much of this on would easily have the husband repair anything in the house. It's important that he's the husband; the permanence of this "normalcy" must be preserved, lest the "normal" class become *uncertain*. To be normal is to be told to not question your reality, because any question might trigger its collapse.

### Patriarchies and parties.

It is not that the man is usually the actor which causes the discomfort though; it's the tools. Tools are basic at the core - hammer, screwdriver, etc - but for any project with modern upgrades involved, the basics don't get you far. Soon you need special saws, nail drivers, pipe cutters, and brackets. Each has their own name and categorization. Each has illogical components to their design, distribution, designation, or all of the above. They exist in a space requisite of deep knowledge to begin: they are gate kept within efficiency. You *can* perform a great deal of repairs with only the simple tools, but you will spend time - compared to the money, to purchase the upgraded tools. But that is capitalist segregation of class, not patriarchal division.

Except, it becomes that, by way of societal expectations. The view of a woman performing her own repairs still somehow elicits a callout by many, when it is as normal as any other home chore. There becomes an expectation that all men must be *knowledgeable* with this skillset, in addition to any other interests; this peculiar standard is, of course, not peculiar to any female-raised person, who is casually expected to hold interests in makeup, sewing, and home economics yet never expected to take pride in them, lest she be seen as vain.

Men, opposedly, are not only expected to take pride in their "craft", but to take on their home as if it were a primary hobby: they must be demonstrating their craft at all times, or their *masculinity* could be called into question. Therefore they must pursue more and more on their own, for bringing in outside assistance is no longer an act if community, but instead a surrender of masculine position. Patriarchy now can classify a further division for men to fight themselves in - builders vs payers. Self-sufficient vs requires help. Individual vs communal. The theme of isolation is prevalent in control structures.

This is not to say that women do not suffer for the same reasons; appearing put together amid chaos, appearing beautiful, appearing to clean and control her household - all of these are common division points sustained only by ethereal definition in order to keep people divided and desiring change via capitalistic means. But they all hinge around these polar definitions: masculinity and femininity. These two centers of gravity have been tasked with balancing society within their orbit, yet without enough crossover that someone might realize that the definitions are farcical. Yet, defined enough to offer the potential to self-alter towards one or the other through enough capital.

In other words: gender role definitions are bullshit; yet, it is natural to embrace them as a way to transition between them. There is nothing definitionally feminine about painting your nails, yet we have flagged it as a feminine activity - and thus, performing it can soothe internal misalignment of gender. It is not always an easy feat to chart the course of how a certain mood or event connects to gender dysphoria.

### Conclusive definitions.

So, if it's all made up, does any of it matter? Does this post have a point, besides being an egotistical exercise in public journalling? Who knows. What I do know, is that this is what my brain decided was the best way to share where I'm at right now, and it's been making some decent calls lately in terms of self-expression.
