Trees are fascinating evolutionary winners. Plants, in general, need to get creative with how they reproduce. With minimum ability to move, they rely on the forces around them to spread beyond where they begin. They grow with virtually no limit beyond the resources available to them. They reshape and change through their lives and constantly regrow their own organs, so long as the roots can provide fresh nutrients.

It makes perfect sense that they've become a common symbol of community between individuals. They make simple metaphors for how groups of individuals grow into something more, branching out and expanding. It's easy to draw comparisons to the way that with proper care, a community can grow strong, and even spread far by delicately transplanting its branches to other places and providing it the support it needs.

We also kill a lot of trees.

The trans community is one that I consider myself *barely* a part of. While I am non-binary and transfeminine, I've always been wary of becoming too involved with any group based solely on an aspect of my identity. This is not for any particular reason, and especially not any reason unique to that community; it's simply how I've operated for most of my life. However, allies can be difficult to find with my gender identity, and there is a value in witnessing the shared experience of both self-discovery and othering that many enby and transgender people go through. Existing on the fringes of that community allows me to engage in careful and considerate ways with others like me, while respecting my own boundaries and priorities.

Trees do not grow in isolated paradise, however, nor does any community. Any community - be it rooted in gender identity, race, shared experiences, fandom, or otherwise - will at some point face challenging realities. Being part of a group of people, whether by birth or choice, does not prevent the flawed humanity of any individual from existing or presenting itself. There exists no community on earth devoid of bad actors, predators, opportunists, or plain-old garden variety assholes, on top those committing the simple human act of flawed decision-making.

It is when a community considers itself beyond such reproach that danger sets in. The more vulnerable a group of individuals is, the more likely such an effect is to happen: being victimized at large can create a response trigger for an attack on a community you have chosen to join, as you project your own qualities onto the larger group. This creates something of a "purity challenge" for many communities; in essence, they feel compelled to either excise and disavow any member that could lead to the group being targeted, for fear of being associated with the failings of that member through the same kind of projection.

As I write this, the trans community is dealing with one such individual. The person in question has already been judged and convicted of their crime, legally even - this post and the larger discussion are not made to question their crimes, nor imply any misconduct of their victim(s). What they did is indefensible, and will not be discussed. If you wish to learn more, feel free to look it up on your own - perhaps it is ironic that you can likely google "transgender assault arrest" and get back very limited results that will lead you to the right place depending on when an article is written, given the amount of political discourse on the topic.

But yes, in a general sense, this post is about Lexi.

Not about their crime though, as stated, but about the community response. The event sits at a tragic intersection of timing and discussion: it occurred in the UK, where transgender rights are under nearly if not even more threat than the US, with those two places being the community branches I'm most connected to. It also comes with the kind of complexities that make any socially-discussed crime a nightmare: their victim largely knew them pre-transition, and offered at least some amount of evidence that their transition could be itself *motivated* by the crime. By the time anyone reads this, all of this information could be very outdated - information moves fast. But the details of the event itself are simply context for the unaware. It is not my place to attempt and declare what is fact in a situation I am wholly disconnected from and merely observing.

Trees are interesting in that they are not monophyletic in origin; that is to say, several distinct, unrelated species all evolved similar traits and attributes that might make them appear to share a common origin, yet have only the smallest true relation. It is understandable why several different plants would thrive as an ever-growing, defended central root, which begins branching off as it persists. The ability to shed damaged parts and grow replacements is a dominant factor in almost any species it has evolved in, and what small amount of control a tree has over its position exhibits a simple intelligent instinct: grow towards the best resources you can find.

Like all species though, trees have flaws and imperfections, as their genetic pattern mutates itself to evolve further and continue existing in an environment that constantly shifts around them. Bad branches grow in, damage causes some sections to decay, and they are of course subject to infection or attack by outsiders the same as anything else. Trees do a pretty good job of self-managing this, in the way evolutionary winners always have; they evolved defensive traits and dangerous qualities to ward away invaders, and take advantage of nature and physics to aid in culling off damaged pieces, to allow fresh growth in their place. Not all trees survive on their own, of course - that is also nature: death is a part of the cycle.

As with most things, humans have taken it upon themselves to "enhance" the process, and while there is a healthy amount of contempt in that statement, it is also true to some degree. We have learned a great deal about how trees function and what is dangerous to them, and develop methods and practices that seek to keep trees growing, and strengthen them quicker than natural ways might. We clip growth that show signs of decay, bind branches to grow in certain directions, and provide it with special conditions a tree would never encounter in nature to speed up its development.

The signature trait of any amateur horticulturist is an overaggressive pair of shears. Clipping branches that do not need to be clipped, trying to "perfect" this growing plant. The very concept that an outside force would understand the *correct* way to alter another entity is the root flaw of many beliefs. It occurs at such a rate that any belief that requires another group to be "corrected" should be an immediate flag for scrutiny and challenge, as it directly implies that something they are doing must be "wrong": *wrong* has a lot of definitions, but *right* has even more, and the concept of each is ripe for abuse by any number of coercive forces, that usually seek to benefit from persisting their own subjective beliefs.

While trans individuals have always existed - with more than enough evidence strewn throughout history, even while frequently forced out of the general consciousness - the trans *community* is closer to a sapling. This makes sense, given the natural rarity of trans identities, even when allowed to flourish; once pockets of queer communities were capable of discovering each other, without the limitations of geographic location and survival-driven coded language, it was finally able to form a more cohesive shared shape. This ends up making the number of trans people appear to be multiplying, and would not be the first time humanity has mistaken a decrease in stealthiness for an increase in population. Much like trees themselves, this form of convergent evolution has lead to a community with strong traits and experiences to bond over, but key differences in how they came to be, and the directions they hope to grow in.

Perhaps as a consequence of how late in our society the community came together properly, it exhibits signs of a community that is much older, largely through mimicking the actions of those communities. It is also a community that has never truly existed without being under attack, an unfortunate commonality for most queer communities. Seemingly as a result of these two traits, it is a community that seems not only willing, but actively *ready* to splinter at a moments notice. Being the target of multiple first-world governments has a way of drawing out the perfectionists, hoping that a "squeaky clean" image will finally lead to acceptance, or even to be embraced. It has also seen the shift in perception towards the communities adjacent to it, the most notable being how the larger LGBTQ+ community slowly entered the mainstream, and desperately hungers for even the level of hostile-acceptance that group has reached in most places.

So when a truly awful member of the community is exposed, the handling of it gets rather messy. You have the "realists" (as I've quite egotistically labeled them - since they are the group I align closest with), simply pointing out that terrible behavior is a sadly *human* trait, rather than directly representative of any community they exist within. But you also have: those who want to disavow the bad actor, in order to not tarnish the "clean image" of the community; those who see any questioning of their position in the community as itself an attack on the community at large; those who *do* see any flaw of an individual as an indicator that the community as a whole is damaged; those who insist that the purity of the community is so strong, that the perpetrator themselves must be innocent; and probably at least a dozen other takes on the issue that I can't even properly recall to list here.

Bad actors within a young community could be seen as a form of trauma, when related to how similar things affect an individual. It is a forced moment of introspection, analyzing how it came to happen, with the equivalent of the "brain" spinning in circles over how to prevent it from happening again. In our lives, each trauma is a point of change in some form, whether it is a shift in how we act or what we believe, or a huge departure from the existence we had before. Events within a community serve the same purpose, cutting into the community bark, as various members begin to sharpen their shears, eager to "repair" whatever they consider the cause - and all too often, unafraid of cutting off other perfectly healthy branches along the way, so long as it means returning the tree to the shape they were once familiar with.

Mix that with the reality that the majority of the trans community is made of individuals that do *not* have a healthy past when it comes to attachment, trauma, relationships, or mental health. This is a touchy subject due to the way that outsiders enjoy designating trans-ness itself as a mental health issue; this dissuades many members from discussing some of the community's shared experiences with trauma and mental health at all, for fear of providing "fuel" to assailants armed with flamethrowers. Nothing I'm writing on this topic is intended to suggest, to even the smallest degree, that a trans or non-binary identity is inherently connected to any such trait or disorder, and anyone who cites it as evidence would be acting in direct malicious ignorance to its stated purpose.

A common insecure attachment within the community leads to a readiness to turn disagreement into transgression. When one individual raises a question with wording that another group may have disingenuously used to attack the community, they are too prepared to "out" a subversive force that has suddenly "revealed" itself, without even considering the validity of the question. The joy and support of the community often feels like a thin tarp merely floating on an ocean of distrust, ready to drown anyone who steps into a topic with too much tension. Combine that with the fact that trans identities, as a general rule, *require* trust between individuals: when one's internal identity conflicts with their presented identity, there is no "proof" available beyond the conviction of the individual. In an ironic way, this makes the trans community almost closer to a religion. If an individual *were* to lie about their gender identity, it is "revealed" only through community judgement of their actions, reinforcing - albeit in a roundabout way - the same belief as those who assault the community: "those who identify as \[X\] must act in similar patterns".

I have no hot take on Lexi's identity, whether currently or when they did what they did. Assault is awful, whether performed by a she, he, they, it, ze, ve, or any other neopronouns or lackthereof, and the belief that I *do* hold firm is that we need to hold *everyone* accountable for their actions. The arguments around Lexi that I have seen do not challenge that, and mostly center around how their punishment will be handled, and how the community will handle the inevitable bad-faith arguments about Lexi's actions that will be levied towards it soon enough. While a more mature world would hopefully handle all of this in a more gender-agnostic way, the world we live in does *not*, particularly given that one of Lexi's historical identities is male, which carries a massive privilege within most of the world, and an equal level of distrust within the community for valid reasons.

When identity comes down to the word of the individual stating it, and their historical identity is the one most strongly associated with both lies and assault, with the biggest challenge to that identity coming from their primary victim - a group nearly *defined* by trauma, and that trauma most commonly inflicted by a more privileged group - is it even possible to process an opinion on the situation, without your biases reshaping it entirely?

I don't know if it is, but I also don't know if it *has* to be. So many members of the community seem to take each trauma, and the handling of each shared grief within their branch of the tree, as some sort of court ruling. They allow it to set "precedence" for how any future situation in a similar shape ought to be handled. The natural confusion of a situation with so many unique details and nuanced truths leads to people seeking a shared opinion, something to reduce the swirl of imperfect information within their brain, so they can try and move on to processing that grief, rather than dwelling in the realm of trying to understand it. It is a desire to seek the truth, noble as that desire is, that leads to dogmatic punishment of anyone who doesn't align with said "truth", no matter how subjective or biased that "truth" is.

I have no idea whether or not Lexi genuinely identifies as their stated identity, and I never will. I have no idea if their identity should be a factor in how their crime is punished or perceived, even though it will be. I am, however, perfectly confident that whatever attacks the community will receive as a result of a member of the community committing such crimes - whether or not they have been disavowed, asterisked, or otherwise - would be made with the same misplaced ferocity no matter what Lexi's identity is or was.

I am also quite confident that while the trans community, like *all* communities, should always work to identify and call out bad actors within it, there is an importance in not harshly judging those with a different view on the situation. This is *not* a simple conflict. Trans-ness, in and of itself, can be a complex reality to live through, before even considering the context present in this case. There is no wrong in disagreeing with others within your own community. Challenging beliefs is how the community came to exist in the first place: open debate about how one can perceive all of this is an opportunity to grow and learn, not an invitation to cull the herd. I am most confident of all in my belief that splintering the community will only make our situation far worse, when there are already so many forces trying to do the same thing from the outside. There's a reason you chop a log up before burning it.

Continue calling out bad actors. Continue believing victims. Continue believing that a trans person is who they say they are. Continue supporting and defending each other. Continue nurturing the community that has formed, and trying to help it grow in a healthy way. Continue to encourage personal growth, and watching for fringe branches of any community that might be headed down a dangerous path towards exclusion or extremism. Just make sure to pause, breathe, and truly think, before aiming the shears at another part of your own tree.
